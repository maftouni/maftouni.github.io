Teaching is one of the most rewarding parts of my work. I enjoy helping students build confidence in
Python, data visualization, and analytical thinking, especially when they are just starting out. My
approach is very hands on. I focus on practical examples, clear explanations, and projects that show
students how data science actually works in real settings.

I have taught graduate courses at Northeastern University and the University of New Haven, covering
topics such as data visualization, applied data engineering, and introductory analytics skills. These
courses combine Tableau, Python, SQL, and storytelling techniques, giving students a strong foundation
to communicate insights and build real data products.

Even when I don’t publish full course materials online, I design all of my lectures, notebooks, and
assignments myself, with the goal of making challenging concepts feel accessible and useful.

Below are the courses and workshops I’ve taught.


**Northeastern University (2025–Present)**
- *ALY 3070: Communication and Visualization for Data Analytics*  
  Undergraduate course focused on Tableau, Python-based visual analytics, storytelling, dashboard design, and communicating insights to broad audiences.

**University of New Haven (2023–2024)**
- *EGRM 6605 – Computing and Modeling for Engineering Management*  
  Graduate course covering Python, SQL, and analytical modeling with a practical, project-based approach.
- *INDE 6605 – Computing and Modeling in Industrial Engineering*  
  Introduced programming, data analysis, and workflow automation for engineering applications.
- *MECH 2201 – Introduction to Applied Programming*  
  Hands-on introduction to Python fundamentals, problem-solving, and computational thinking for engineering students.

**Workshops and Short Courses**
