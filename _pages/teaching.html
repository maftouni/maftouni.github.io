Teaching has always been one of my favorite parts of working in data. I love that moment when a concept
goes from feeling abstract or intimidating to “oh, I can actually do this.”

I teach data visualization, Python, and applied data engineering, with a focus on helping students build
things that feel real: dashboards, notebooks, small data products, and workflows they could show to a
future manager. My classes are very hands on, and I try to connect every topic to a concrete example,
whether it is a Tableau dashboard, a Kaggle notebook, or an automated pipeline.

I have taught graduate courses at Northeastern University and the University of New Haven, mentored
students through project based assignments, and created step by step materials for learners who are new
to programming and analytics.

Below are some of the courses, workshops, and materials I have created or taught.
