I am Maede, a Ph.D. candidate in [Industrial Engineering at Virginia Tech](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/graduate/phd/maftouni.html), and 2020-2021's Vice president of INFORMS student chapter at VT. I have my Master's degree from the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department of Virginia Tech. I have also received the graduate certificate in Data Analytics from the [Discovery Analytics Center](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/academics/data-analytics/) at Virginia Tech.
I am a member of the [Smart Manufacturing Analytics Research & Technology (SMART) Laboratory](https://www.smartlab-vt.com/team) under the supervision of [Dr. James Kong](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/kong.html). I have achieved two primary research goals so far; First, I proposed and implemented a novel approach for Covid-19 diagnosis. Second, I proposed and implemented deep learning structures for video object segmentation and tracking for additive manufacturing. 

I enjoy utilizing data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning methods to turn data into actionable insights, automatic systems, and interactive visualizations. I have worked with different data types, including time series, text, images, and videos, in industrial and medical projects. My end goal is to work as a data scientist and contribute to high-impact projects deriving value from raw data.
