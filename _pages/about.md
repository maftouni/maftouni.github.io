I am Maede, a Ph.D. holder in [Industrial Engineering from Virginia Tech](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/graduate/phd/maftouni.html), currently employed as a Data Scientist at [Quantum-Si](https://www.quantum-si.com/). My educational background includes Master's and Bachelor's degrees in Industrial and Systems Engineering, with a strong emphasis on data analytics, learning techniques, and system thinking. I have also earned a graduate certificate in Data Analytics from the [Discovery Analytics Center](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/academics/data-analytics/) at Virginia Tech.

During my Ph.D., I was a part of the [Smart Manufacturing Analytics Research & Technology (SMART) Laboratory](https://www.smartlab-vt.com/team), working under the guidance of [Dr. James Kong](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/faculty/kong.html). My research revolved around achieving two primary objectives. Firstly, I introduced and executed an innovative approach for Covid-19 diagnosis. Secondly, I designed and implemented deep learning models for video object segmentation and tracking in the context of additive manufacturing.

I find great satisfaction in utilizing data analytics, machine learning, and deep learning methodologies to transform raw data into actionable insights, automated systems, and interactive visualizations, including executive dashboards. My experience spans a wide range of data types, encompassing time series data, text data, images, and videos, in both industrial and medical projects. My ultimate aim is to make significant contributions to high-impact projects as a dedicated data scientist.
