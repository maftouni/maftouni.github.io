Hi, I’m Maede Maftouni, a Senior Data Scientist who loves turning complex data into tools that help people make better decisions. My work sits at the intersection of machine learning, data engineering, and insightful visualization, and I’ve always been drawn to problems where clarity and real impact matter just as much as accuracy.

I’m currently at Socure building data products that surface real-time operational signals, automate insights, and make vendor and system performance easier to understand and optimize. Before that, I worked at Quantum-Si, where I designed machine learning models for protein sequencing hardware and built end-to-end data pipelines that supported both R&D and manufacturing. I earned my Ph.D. in [Industrial Engineering from Virginia Tech](https://www.ise.vt.edu/people/graduate/phd/maftouni.html), along with a [graduate certificate in Data Analytics](https://dac.cs.vt.edu/academics/data-analytics/).

My work spans across medical imaging, manufacturing, biotech, and large-scale operational analytics. I enjoy projects that blend modeling, storytelling, and systems thinking, whether that means predicting hardware parameters, analyzing time series patterns, or building dashboards that help teams spot issues before they become problems. I work comfortably across text, time series, images, and video, and I use Python, SQL, Airflow, AWS, Tableau, and Streamlit almost every day.

My research background shaped how I approach problems. During my Ph.D., as a part of the [SMART Laboratory](https://www.smartlab-vt.com/team), I developed interpretable deep learning models for COVID-19 CT scan diagnosis and for video segmentation in additive manufacturing. That experience taught me how to move fluidly between experimentation, modeling, validation, and communication in a practical, grounded way.

At the core of everything I build is the same goal: transform raw, messy data into something reliable, understandable, and genuinely useful. I care about clarity, real-world impact, and designing solutions that teams can trust and use with confidence.
