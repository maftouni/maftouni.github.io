## Project overview
 <img src="/images/real_estate_project.png"
This project explores housing trends across the United States using publicly available real estate data.
I first cleaned and explored the data in Python, then designed an interactive Tableau dashboard, and
finally recorded a short YouTube walkthrough to explain the main insights and design choices.

## My role and tools

- **Role:** End-to-end design and implementation  
- **Tools:** Python (Pandas, visualization), Tableau Public, Kaggle, YouTube  

## What the project shows

- How to wrangle raw real estate data in a Jupyter notebook  
- How to translate analysis into an interactive Tableau dashboard for non-technical audiences  
- How to present the story in a short video so others can quickly understand the insights
